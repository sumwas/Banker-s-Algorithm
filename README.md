# Bankers-Algorithm
Objective: 
To implement resource allocation and demonstrate deadlock avoidance using the 
Banker's algorithm. 
 
Specification: 
The program simulates resource allocation to requesting processes and demonstrates 
deadlock avoidance with the Banker's algorithm. A menu controls the operations, and 
each choice calls the appropriate procedure, where the choices are:  
1) Enter parameters 
2) Run the Banker's algorithm to determine a safe sequence 
3) Quit program and free memory
